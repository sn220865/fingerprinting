    <h2>Is it possible to defend against browser fingerprinting?</h2>
    
    Browser fingerprinting is quite a powerful method of tracking users around the
    Internet.  There are some defensive measures that can be taken with existing
    browsers, but none of them are ideal.
    
    <h3>Try to use a "non-rare" browser</h3>
    
    <p>The most obvious way to try to prevent browser fingerprinting is to pick a
    "standard", "common" browser.  It turns out that this is surprisingly hard
    to do.  It appears that the <a
    href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2010/01/tracking-by-user-agent">most
    likely candidate</a> would be the latest version of Firefox
    running on a modern Windows version.  But even so, many of those Firefox on
    Windows browsers can be distinguished from one another by the enourmous
    range of plugin versions and fonts that can be installed with them.</p>
    
    <p>Pending the results of the Panopticlick experiment, the only browsers
    which we believe really meet the conflicting criteria of being common but
    not accompanied by high-<a
    href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2010/01/primer-information-theory-and-privacy">entropy</a>
    plugin and font configurations are the browsers in smartphones.  This is not
    intuitive, since these browsers tend to be less common than desktop
    browsers.  But, importantly, there are few other variables beyond the user
    agent.  Current versions of the iPhone, Android, and Blackberries do not
    vary much with respect to plugins, installed fonts, or screen size.  This
    situation may well change in the future, but until it does, most of these
    devices are far less fingerprintable than any sort of desktop PC.</p>
    
    <h3>Disable JavaScript</h3>
    
    <p>Disabling JavaScript is a powerful defense against browser fingerprinting,
    because it cuts off the methods that websites can use to detect plugins and
    fonts, as well as preventing the use of most kinds of supercookie.
    Unfortunately, JavaScript is necessary to make a lot of sites work well.</p>
    
    <p>At least two ways to block some sites from using JavaScript while
    allowing others to use it are available.  One, <a
    href="http://noscript.net">NoScript</a>, tends to be overprotective: it will
    block JavaScript everywhere and allow you to manually reenable it for some
    sites.  This is a lot of work, and requires good intuitions about when a
    site isn't working because JavaScript is disabled.  The other, <a
    href="http://adblockplus.org/en/">AdBlock Plus</a>, tends to be
    underprotective.  AdBlock Plus tends to be quite good at blocking ads,
    because users can instantly see when they're present.  Tracking or
    fingerprinting scripts are generally invisible, so even the AdBlock Plus
    subscriptions that <a href="http://easylist.adblockplus.org/">focus on
    privacy</a> will tend to miss a lot of tracking sites.</p>
    
    <h3>Use TorButton</h3>
    
    Modern versions of <a
    href="https://www.torproject.org/torbutton/">TorButton</a> "standardize"
    various browser charcteristics like the User Agent string, in order to
    prevent them from being used to track Tor users.  TorButton is also quite
    agressive at blocking JavaScript in the browser.  Taken together, these
    measures make TorButton a strong defense against fingerprinting.
    Unfortunately, browsing through Tor is currently a lot slower than browsing
    without it.
    
    <h3>A Better Solution: Browsers' "Private Browsing" Modes</h3>
    
    <p>There is a lot that browser and plugin developers could do to protect
    their users against fingerprint tracking.  In general, it might not be a
    good engineering decision to remove all of the version-number entropy from
    browsers, since knowing the precise version of flash, quicktime, or
    whatever, is occasionally useful for debugging.</p>
    
    <p>One solution would be to add a "debugging" mode to browsers, and to round
    version numbers off when the browser is not in debugging mode.  Another
    solution would be to improve the <a
    href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_mode">"private browsing"
    modes</a> that are already present in most modern browsers, so that when the
    mode is active, User Agent, <tt>navigator.plugins</tt> and font lists take
    on standardized values (or, perhaps, normalized values).</p>
